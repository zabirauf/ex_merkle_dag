#MerkleDAG (In Development)

[Merkle DAG](https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/20) is the data structure powering the Git and [IPFS](http://ipfs.io).
It has the benefits of
* Integrity check
* Deduplication
* Content Addressing

It can be used to build variou awesome things and IPFS is a great example of it. This is an attempt to implement MerkleDAG in Elixir so that in the future other things can be built on top of it. It is using [Go-IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) implementation as reference.

It is still in **heavy development** and now way functional yet.
